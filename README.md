# fruit-classification
This project uses machine learning and computer vision to classify images of fruits: apples, bananas, and oranges. The goal is to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can correctly identify the type of fruit in an image.

## Summary
This project is a **Building AI course project** that uses machine learning and computer vision to classify images of fruits: apples, bananas, and oranges. The model predicts the type of fruit in a given image.  

## Description
The project demonstrates the use of **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** for image classification. Images are preprocessed and fed into a CNN model built with TensorFlow/Keras. The model is trained to recognize different types of fruits with good accuracy.

## Data
Images are organized into folders by category:
You can use datasets like [Kaggle Fruit Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moltean/fruits).  

## Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fruit-classification.git
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
python train.py
python predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg
